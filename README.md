# INSURANCE PREMIUM PREDICTION USING MLOPS
#
### Problem Statement:
The Goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on their indivisual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health insurance carrier and its plan and perks while keeping the projected cost from out study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an insurance policy rather than the ineffective part.

### Approach:d
The classical Machine Learning Task like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithm that's best fit for the above case. Some Famous Algorithms:-Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Gradient Boosting, Desicision tree, Regression

### Results:
We have to build a solution that should be able to predict the premium of the personal for the Health Insurance
